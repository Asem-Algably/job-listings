## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I made a react app with a state of key words which starts as an empty array then I created three functions one to remove keywords, one to add key words, and one to clear the array then I passed them to the chirldren properties so they can edit the main state while the display of the job components is based on a filter function that check whether or not it does have the required key words 

### Continued development
